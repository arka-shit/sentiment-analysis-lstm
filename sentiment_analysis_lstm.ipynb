You can live chat with an agent which is great because I could do it from my desk at work which still doing my work)  They called Thai One On for me and was told someone from management would phone me the next day.

Excuse me, where does it say that you have to pay with cash if you order rice plates? The total bill was over $20. The policy is that credit cards are accepted if the total bill is at least $20.

I was skeptical of how good take-out pho would be, but it worked quite well.  The broth was still hot when we got home and it had a very similar quality whether I ate it at the restaurant or at home on the couch.  \n",

      "The Cambridge is the home of the most famous burgers in Edinburgh, a reputation that is well deserved. The burgers are excellent and the bar itself is great with a good selection of drinks and a nice atmosphere. If you don't like burgers then don't go there because that's all they sell! The bar is small so it's best to book a table if you want to eat - they only take 5 bookings per evening (as they wish to operate more as a bar than a restaurant) so get in quick! In all, this is one of the best places in Edinburgh to get a relaxed meal and has a great atmosphere every night of the week, being particularly busy when big football matches are on due to the big screens.\n",
